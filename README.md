# Binary-Classifier

The Objective is to build an efficient classifier that will predict whether the loan will be paid off or deaulted based on certain selected feautures.
I have used 4 different classificaion techniques such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression and then compared their accuracies.
Three different types of accuracies have been used namely, Jaccardian index, F1-score and log-loss to carefully judge which model will be the most efficient
